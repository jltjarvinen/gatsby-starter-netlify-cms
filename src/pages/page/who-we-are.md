We focus on bridging world-known Finnish education solutions with the African Education Development Agenda.

Why Africa?

Africa is a continent on the rise, many of the largest growing economies are from the African continent. At the same time, due to population growth the there has been a massive growth in the workforce, with young Africans moving into the workforce. However, the education opportunities offered to children and youth are not yet sufficient.

The growing population poses a challenge that demands for innovative approaches, so that quality education that leads to employment can be offered for more and ultimately to all youth.

SkillSafari aims to be part of that solutions. As a country, Finland has built an education system providing quality learning to all its citizen, thus transforming itself from a developing country to a leading country in education and innovation. By putting the wellbeing and education of its citizen at the core, Finland has come up with education solutions that are economical, effective and scalable at a national level.

The Founder & CEO of SkillSafari, Mrs Satu JÃ¤rvinen was raised in Senegal as a child and moved to Finland at the age of 13. Through her childhood years spent in Africa and later years in Finland working in innovation, development and teacher training activities within the Finnish education system, Satu has a unique perspective on both the south and the north. Not to mention an everlasting affection for the continent that gave her a happy childhood under the African sun.
